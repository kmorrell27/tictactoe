# tictactoe

Simple tic-tac-toe implementation in JavaScript

I made this around Halloween and decided that the only flaw with tic-tac-toe
was that sometimes it just wasn't festive enough, and who am I to refuse the
task of fixing a game dating back 2000 years?

The CPU is using a variation of the minimax algorithm called negamax to play
perfectly every time. In the event of Global Thermonuclear War, show this code
to WOPR to save humanity.

You can see the game in action at http://kmorrell.com/2014/10/06/tic-tac-toe.html
